![Holidaze Image](public/HolidazeImg.jpg)

This project is a holiday venue booking platform developed as part of the final exam for Front-End Development at Noroff.

## Description

Holidaze is a holiday venue booking platform where users can browse, book, and manage their stay at various holiday venues. The platform provides a seamless experience with features like venue search, booking management, and a responsive design optimized for mobile devices. This project was developed as part of the final exam for Project Exam 2 in the Front-End Development course at Noroff. The app was built using React for the front-end, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite for fast builds and development.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without having to write custom CSS.
- **Styled Components**: A library for styling components in React using tagged template literals.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that helps maintain a consistent code style.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool that serves the app in development mode and bundles it for production.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool to identify and fix problems in JavaScript code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/renahashimi/holidaze-pe2.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd holidaze-pe2
   ```

3. **Install the project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the app in your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app running locally.

## Development

To start the live development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in development mode using Vite.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build for Production

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed.

## Preview Production Build

### `npm run preview`

Preview the production build locally after building it. This command will serve the app as it will be deployed.

## Format Code

### `npm run format`

Formats the code using Prettier to ensure consistent code style across the project.

## Run Tests

### `npm run test`

Currently, no tests are defined in the project. This command is reserved for running tests when added.
